  challenge:
    'Shortleap was developed as a fullstack application challenge, where the objective was to go beyond the frontend and design a complete solution from database to user interface. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, Turso, and Auth.js, the project combines backend logic, authentication, analytics, and a responsive, user-focused interface. This project reflects my ability to plan, implement, and polish a full product experience â€” including technical depth, clean design, and attention to performance.',

    text: 'Shortleap is a custom URL shortener built entirely from scratch. It includes user authentication, link management, analytics tracking, and UI/UX polish through animations and visual feedback. The backend uses a relational database (Turso) with Drizzle ORM, and the frontend is crafted with React, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts for data visualization. All features are designed to be accessible, responsive, and scalable.',

  solution:
    'Shortleap demonstrates my ability to deliver a full product from backend logic to frontend polish. The result is a performant, modern, and user-friendly URL shortener that balances technical architecture with thoughtful UI. This project allowed me to deepen my experience in backend development while applying advanced frontend practices.',
