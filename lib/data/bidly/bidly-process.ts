    "This project required introducing a meaningful technical improvement to an existing application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS. Instead of adding visual changes, I chose to focus on code quality by implementing automated tests â€” a decision aimed at strengthening the project's robustness and improving my skills as a professional frontend developer.",

  solution:
    'The implementation resulted in a comprehensive test suite covering utility functions, UI components, and complex interaction patterns. Tests are isolated, descriptive, and organized by domain. Dependencies like Zustand and React Router were carefully mocked to simulate different UI states. The testing infrastructure is maintainable, with appropriate configuration and documentation. The end result is a more stable and maintainable codebase, with testing coverage in place for both logic and interface components.',
