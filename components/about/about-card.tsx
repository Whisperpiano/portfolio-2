          I&apos;m Jes√∫s Alberola Herrero, a passionate musician and programmer
          from Spain. From a young age, my two great loves have been music and
          technology.

        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          In 2019, after a decade of intensive studies at the Villena
          Professional Conservatory of Music, I graduated as a piano teacher and
          music composer. That was when I decided to embark on a new adventure
          and moved to picturesque Norway. Currently, I have the honor of being
          a piano teacher at Sandnes Kulturskole, where I enjoy sharing my love
          for music with young talents.

          But... there was always an additional spark in my life: programming.
          Since childhood, I have been fascinated by video games and computers,
          and that interest never disappeared. So, in 2023, I decided to make an
          exciting career shift and started studying front-end development to
          fulfill that latent passion.
