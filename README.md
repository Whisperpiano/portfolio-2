This portfolio isn't just a collection of projects—it's a small digital experience. I've tried to pay attention to detail with a clean dark theme and a few subtle animations that I hope you'll enjoy. It’s a reflection of what I’ve learned so far and the kind of work I enjoy building as a developer.

## Want to Run it Locally?

Why not? It's more fun than watching cat videos (well, almost):

```bash
# Clone this magical repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-noroff-2.git

# Enter the dimensional portal
cd portfolio-noroff-2

# Install dependencies (and possibly the entire internet)
pnpm install

# Start the fusion reactor (development server)
pnpm run dev
```

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and behold the wonder.
